# TCRosetta_code
TCRosetta, a powerful platform for analyzing and annotating TCR repertoire. Above 244 million TCR sequences with disease information are integrated into the webserver, enabling big-data-based TCR annotation for the first time. The main functions of TCRosetta are as follows. (i) TCR repertoire general feature analysis (e.g., diversity, V/J gene usage, length distribution, and clonality); (ii) evaluate the disease preference of TCR repertoire and sequence; (iii) TCR repertoire network construction and analysis; (iv) calculate generation probability of TCR sequences. TCRosetta is the first comprehensive online server for TCR repertoire analysis and is useful for immunology research. TCRosetta is freely available at http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/TCRosetta/.
